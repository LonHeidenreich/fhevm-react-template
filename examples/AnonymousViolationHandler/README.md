# Anonymous Violation Handler

A privacy-focused traffic violation reporting system built on blockchain technology using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to protect user privacy while maintaining transparency in traffic law enforcement.

## üîê Core Concept: FHE-Based Anonymous Violation Processing

The Anonymous Violation Handler leverages **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** technology to enable privacy-preserving traffic violation management. This revolutionary approach allows for:

- **Anonymous Reporting**: Citizens can report traffic violations without revealing their identity
- **Encrypted Processing**: All sensitive data is processed while remaining encrypted
- **Privacy Protection**: License plate information is automatically anonymized and encrypted
- **Transparent Operations**: Violation records are stored on-chain while maintaining privacy
- **Secure Payments**: Payment verification system with cryptographic proofs

## üöó Privacy Traffic Violation Processing

Our system transforms traditional traffic enforcement by introducing a decentralized, privacy-first approach:

### Key Features
- **Encrypted License Plate Storage**: Vehicle identification data is converted to anonymous hashes
- **Confidential Violation Types**: Support for multiple violation categories with encrypted processing
- **Anonymous Payment System**: Secure fine payment with privacy-preserving verification
- **Decentralized Records**: Immutable violation records stored on blockchain
- **Admin Controls**: Administrative functions for fine management and payment processing

### Violation Types Supported
- Speeding violations
- Illegal parking
- Red light violations
- Seatbelt violations
- Mobile phone usage while driving

## üåê Live Application

**Website**: [https://anonymous-violation-handler.vercel.app/](https://anonymous-violation-handler.vercel.app/)

## üîç How It Works

1. **Violation Reporting**: Users input violation details, which are automatically encrypted and anonymized
2. **Blockchain Storage**: Encrypted data is stored on-chain with unique violation IDs
3. **Payment Processing**: Violators can make payments using cryptographic proofs
4. **Verification**: Payments are verified and recorded without revealing personal information
5. **Administrative Oversight**: Authorized personnel can manage fines and process payments

## üèõ Governance & Administration

The system includes administrative controls for:
- Fine amount management per violation type
- Payment verification and processing
- System parameter adjustments
- Violation record queries

## üîí Security & Privacy

- **End-to-End Encryption**: All sensitive data remains encrypted throughout the process
- **Anonymous Identifiers**: No personal information is stored on-chain
- **Secure Randomization**: Cryptographically secure random number generation
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for different user types
- **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction history while maintaining privacy
