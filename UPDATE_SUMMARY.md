## 🎯 Key Changes

### Video Demo Clarification
**Important**: The demo.mp4 file must be **downloaded** from the repository to watch. Online streaming links are not supported.

All documentation now clearly states:
- "Download `demo.mp4` from repository"
- "Video requires download to watch"
- No broken streaming links

### Consistent Link Placement
All major documentation files now show the three key links prominently:
1. GitHub Repository
2. Live Demo
3. Video Demo (with download notice)

### No Placeholder Links
All placeholder links removed:
- ❌ `[Repository URL]`
- ❌ `[Deployment URL]`
- ❌ `[GitHub Link]`
- ❌ `your-demo-link.vercel.app`

All replaced with actual URLs:
- ✅ https://github.com/LonHeidenreich/fhevm-react-template
- ✅ https://violation-handler.vercel.app/
- ✅ Download `demo.mp4` (clear instructions)
